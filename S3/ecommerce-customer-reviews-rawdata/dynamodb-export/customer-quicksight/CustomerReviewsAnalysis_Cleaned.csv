"0","E007WTAJTS","5","A34EWDQHHS9UD6","No questionit is really as fast as its rated. How fast? Wellclass &#34;10 SDHC&#34; means literally SD formatHC=High CapacityClass 10 = 10MB/sec read-write. How fast is 10MB per second? WellClass 4the most common step down (i.e. cheaper) is Class 4i.e. 4MB/sec. So Class 10 is 2.5 times faster. Why pay the difference?Digital cameras: at some point the number of pictures/sec or HD video is bottle-necked by the speed of the media it is being recorded to.Smart phones? I have a Samsung Note II. A Quad-core processorwiz-bang yadda-yadda. YesI DO notice speed differences in cameraapp performance (I use a spreadsheet app/browser/NetFlix/Music streaminget al) is noticeably FASTER. Where do you think the phone stores stuff to when it doesnt use the factory installed memory? (iPhomes dont have an SD slotand I wouldnt own a phone or tablet that doesnt -- I believe in choice in the computer realm)Oh yeahSanDisk is a leader and pioneer in the SD format (where do you think the SD came from?). The only other SDHC Class 10 card worthy of comparison is the Samsung brandbut then I might be biased on that one.","13-04-2013","Icewalker","POSITIVE","0.23547451198101044","0.0359160341322422","0.2373536378145218","0.49125584959983826","Fast as fast currently gets in SD","0","1365811200"

I installed it in my Samsung Tabletbut could not successfully transfer files using either a USB cable or WiFi.  The file transfer would appear to startbut then would slow down and hang completely.  It did this on every one of multiple attemptswith different file typesand numbers of files ranging from many to just a single file.  I tried loading files onto the card directly from my PCbut then the Tablet would not see them.  I tried reformatting the card both in my PC and in the Tabletbut still got the same result.  After a few triesthe Tablet would appear to format the card but then tell me that the card was blank/unformatted.  I did an A/B/A with an old 8GB Sandisk Micro SD Card that I had laying around.  It worked perfectly -- formatingtransferring filesreading and writing files -- everthing worked.  I put the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Card back in the Tabletbut had the same problems again.  I concluded that the SanDisk Ultra card was defective and returned it.

Would never mount.  Tried to format it with my computer....and still just wouldnt work..although it would be formatted.  RememberI was using all defaults.Sent it backAmazon sent me another one. (Amazingly fast service)...same thing.I called Amazon...they knew of no issue why my tablet wouldnt accept the card. (I would think that their customer service dept. would stay on top of these posts because I found that this was a HUGE issue)On my THIRD card I did some research.  For whatever reason for this SD card to work it must be formatted as a FAT 32 NOT an exFAT.  BUT...(this is the rub)...windows only allows for formatting either to exFAT or NTSF...(at firstI thought it was an adult swim reference).....so....that sucks....this means that I cant use this card because I cant format it properly.  But wait..theres more....there is a super easy fix....any idiot can do it.....from start to finish took me all of 45 seconds (after reading instructions)...and ta-duh.....now the micro SD card works fine. Thank-you Amazon for your excellent return policy..(super fastsuper easysuper friendly)...BUT your live customer service should know about this.  I cant fault the operator...she was nice..seemed genuinely concerned and tried to make it right)...ok.. no more stalling..here is the address of the youtube video.  link to website is in the description.[...] ...link to website in description.

"5","E007WTAJTS","3","A3G19SJMZO3NZW","I purchased this card on a daily lighting deal for my new Samsung Galaxy Note II. It was recognized without issues. I connected it with its adapter to my computers card reader to transfer about 3Gb of data and the best consistent transfer rate (average) was roughly 13Mbps... Thats less than %50 of the advertised transfer rate.To be fairIve used the same external card reader with my Sony HX100 digital camera with an SD card (16Gb class 10) and I get double the transfer rate of what Ive gotten for this card.Here is the setup:1- SD Adapter included with this card.2- External 12-in-1 USB 2.0 card reader connected to a USB 2.0 port on my PC3- Files transferred were of varying sizes.4- Transferred from 2TB Seagate X2 SATA3 HDD (connected to SATA2 port)5- Windows 8 Enterprise x64 (oh yah baby)The only excuse I give this card for its bad performance is the files were relatively small sizes but some of them were as large as 50Mb... This still does not justify the very low transfer rate.I am not really picky because this card will reside inside my super phone but still it does not justify the money paid for this card.I hope this will help others.","31-10-2012","H.
